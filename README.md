# This project demonstrates the use of the ETL Method (Extract, Transform, Load) and knowledge of Microsoft Excel, Python and the Pandas Library, and the SQL database application. Raw data about crowdfunding campaigns was extracted from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, the information was gathered, cleaned, and reorganized using Python and Pandas dataframes into useful dataframes of information, then transformed into CSV files to be readable by the SQL database. An ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was created showing how the various datapoints were related to each other, and from there a SQL database was coded and the information was then loaded into SQL to create an easy to use database.
