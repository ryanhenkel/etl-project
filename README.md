This project showcases the adept utilization of the ETL Method (Extract, Transform, Load) in conjunction with a comprehensive grasp of Microsoft Excel, Python, the Pandas Library, and the SQL database framework. Initially, raw data concerning crowdfunding campaigns was meticulously extracted from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Subsequently, employing Python and Pandas data frames, the data underwent a process of extraction, cleansing, and strategic reorganization, culminating in the creation of coherent and valuable data frames. These refined datasets were then transformed into CSV files, optimized for seamless integration within the SQL database environment.

To visually capture the intricate relationships between various data points, an intricately crafted Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was meticulously constructed. This ERD artfully depicted the interconnections among different data elements. Building upon this foundational visualization, a robust SQL database was engineered. The culmination of this effort involved the transfer of the prepared CSV files into the SQL database, yielding an intuitively navigable and user-friendly repository of data.
